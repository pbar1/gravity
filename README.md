# Gravity

Today in history: the first picture of a black hole was taken

## Goal

Swiss army knife for developers to be successful and move faster when working on the Einstein Platform.

## Usage

```
gravity list
```

## Design

Gravity is a CLI tool configured remotely using Consul. That way, developers using the tooling can have immediate updates to configuration. Feature flags are even possible. (Einstein wouldn't be thrilled about this, as it seems kinda like [spooky action at a distance][1]!)
